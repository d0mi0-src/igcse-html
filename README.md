The main goal of this website is to make it to function as an archive for all resources that can help egyptian and arab igcse students. 

This is implemented through very basic html code and nothing else.
It has the green on black hacker theme.

it js consits of pages, buttons, paragraphs, and the archives r just pages with tons of hyperlinks to all resources I was able to gather. 
This is for the igcse sytem intro and resources and communities pages.

For the droos-lens page, it is designed to work differently, as I dont have enough reviews and igcse-related knowledge to make it, so I js made it in this form
so that users can contribute by writing their reviews of all the teachers, I review and compare them to make sure they are valid, and add them as pages and create
a page containing hyperlinks of all those pages.

to add some cool motivation to make the users contribute to the website, comes the role of the hall of fame, where every contributor's name is added, along with how he helped
the site.

As I mentioned, its all with that geeky hacker theme, so I need to add some related activity, here comes the easter eggs, all the source code is filled with easter eggs, 
comments, commented code, and even additional pages with comedian comments and text, and any user who finds those easter eggs, gets his/her name added to the hall of fame too.

Also, any user who pointed out valid bugs or issues, also gets his/her name added to the hall of fame.
They can communicate through the contact page, one with the email and the other through telegram.

The goal is to make it an entire platform where arab igcse students can exchange material freely, as this project is 100% free. Hopefully, if the site grows, I can automate
the upload of files to the site and the upload of reviews, add search functionalities...

Overall, this is a very very basic html site when it comes to code, every a 3rd grader can write the code without any problem, but I tried to show how we can make
functional sites using the most basic tools and languages, and that those webistes can even affect people's lives regardless of how basic or simple to implement they are.
