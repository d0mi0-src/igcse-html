    <p>the 'droos lens' page was supposed to be the first of its kind in the arab world - a full directory with real reviews, contacts and notes of all tuition teachers.</p>
    <p>but due to very little community input and communications, we couldn't complete it.</p>
    <p>want to help us build it?</p>
    <p>if you've tried a good (or bad) teacher, share your review in the following format</p>
    <pre>
      - your name or online username [optional]
      - Are you a student or parent?
      - teacher name + subject (along with board, and level)
      - the session (+ year) when you took the subject with him
      - location or online
      - price range [optional]
      - contact info
      - and most importantly, your honest review
    </pre>
    <p>then send it to <a>@d0mi0</a> on telegram, and you will be added to the <strong>hall of fame</strong></p>
    <p>additional information on how to contact us can be found in the <a href="contact_blue.html">contact us page</a></p>
    <center>
      <p>the page will launch once we have enough real data.</p>
      <p>no fake reviews. no ads. just honest information for students by students.</p>
