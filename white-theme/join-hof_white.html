    <p>How to earn your place in the hall of fame</p>
  </center>
  <p>There are two ways to earn a place in the hall of fame. 
  </p>
  <p>1. Finding easter eggs</p>
  <p>You can earn your place in the hall of fame by finding easter eggs. You can find easter eggs in the code, hidden pages, hidden files, or even hidden subdomains. Whenever you find an easter egg, just dm me (<a href="contact_white.html">info on how to dm me is in the contact us page</a>) and tell me abt what you found, along with a POF or proof of concept (like a screenshot, or screenrecording) showing what you found. I will then review your report, and if its valid, your name will be added to hall of fame. However, if its invalid, I will text you back telling you thats its invalid and why its invalid.</p>
  <p>2. Through Contributions</p>
  <p>what you can contribute:</p>
  <pre>
    - your own notes (any subject)
    - google drive folders with pastpapers, solved guides, or cheat sheets
    - youtube playlists or useful videos
    - rare resources that aren't linked anywhere
    - bug reports (broken links, typos, missing pages)
    - anything that improves the archive
  </pre>
  <p>check the <a href="contact_white.html">contact us page</a> for details on how to send your suggestions</p>
  <p>what happens next:</p>
  <pre>
    - I check it manually
    - If it's real, useful, and not already present in the archive, I add it to the site
    - You get credit in the hall of fame (with or without your name)
    - That's it. No forms. No waiting. Just help and get remembered
  </pre>
  <p>this site runs on contributions. be part of something real and make it better for the next student who's lost.</p>
